This repository consolidate more than 2,600 [Microsoft Visio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/microsoft-365/visio) artefacts that I have collected and used over the years.

Your stencils and templates library does not have to be unique, everyone strives for consistency. Fork this repository and improve *your* library. Even better, send me an update :)

There is 1000 IT stencils older than 2019 because I have them and organizations are still using them. You'll find items from 3Com, Adtran, Avaya, Avocent, BlueCat, BlueSocket, Chatsworth, Dell, Extreme Network, F5, Foundry, IronPort, Juniper, Linksys, Netgate PFSense, Nortel, Palo Alto Network, Polycom, QNAP, Radware, Riverbed Network, SonicWall, Sourcefire, TippingPoint, Vyatta, and ZyXEl.

There is _only_ 702 current IT stencils, sadly most vendors does not update them frequently. You'll find items from Cisco, CommScope, CyberPower, Datwyler, Dell, HellermannTyton, Fortinet, HPE, Juniper, Kubernetes, Microsoft, Palo Alto Networks, Panduit, Raritan, Synology, SYSTIMAX, TP-Link, Tripp Lite, Unquiti, Uniprise, Veeam, and VMWare.

I also have electronic stencils, and related to IT Methodologies including ADAPT v3, Archimate, BPMN, C4, CORAS, CMMN, DMN, IDEF5, TOGAF and UML.

I normalize filenames to keep my sanity:
 * Replace all dashes and underscores with a space
 * Add the vendor name as prefix
 * Add the version as suffix

Obviously, I don't remember all the sources. The usual suspect are the vendors websites.

I try to keep them as _fresh_ as possible by manually accessing the vendors website on a regular basis. Refer to [Stencils](stencils.md) for more information.

If you don't find something, try third party commercial shape vendors such as [3DN](https://3d-networking.com/3d-symbols/), [NetZoom](www.NetZoom.com), [Shape Source](www.shapesource.com), [Visimation](www.visimation.com), or [Visio Café](http://www.visiocafe.com/).

## Installation procedure

1. Close Microsoft Visio
2. Clone or download the repository
3. Copy all the stencils (e.g., .vss and .vssx) to C:\Users\<Username>\Documents\My Shapes
4. Microsoft Visio will recognize all stencil files in the _My Shapes_ folder

You can do the same thing for templates (e.g., .vst, .vstm and .vstx) and the documents (e.g., .vsd, and .vsdx)

In doubt refer to this [Microsoft instruction](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/import-downloaded-stencils-74bbdce1-4872-4d5b-af4c-e93fa23f7008).

Drawing scale should be set to 1”=10” which is the de facto industry standard for network VISIO shapes. Scale modification might cause unsatisfactory results.
